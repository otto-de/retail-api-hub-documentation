## Severity levels

- All errors with a severity level of *error* lead to a rejection of the entire product/variant (depending on the level
  of the error). The product/variant will not be created/updated at all.
- All errors with a severity level of *warning* lead to a rejection of the individual attribute or inform about a not
  provided attribute: The product/variant will still be created/updated in general, however the individual attribute
  will not be set or - in case of an update - it will be reset.
